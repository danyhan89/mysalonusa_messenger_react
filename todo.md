- [X] business on sale
- [X] job show page
- [X] initial page styling
- [x] display correct alias for job post
- [X] send email on apply to job
- [X] have job id in url when viewing job


TODOS:
- [X] provide min length feedback on apply to job message

- [ ] Reorganize categorization/navigation of the site
		- [languages] -> [state] -> dashboard with menu -
			Salon Chatroom
			Restaurant Chatroom

- [ ] open up separate chatroom through the site between job seeker + job poster
	  may require both party to create account
- [ ] apply job through SMS texts by inputting phone number
		* "We will send text for you, and they will text you back on this number"

- [ ] When job owner posts a job, show them options on how they want to be contacted, through email, sms, chatroom through the site.

- [ ] When creating job post - give options in where they want to post the job, 	or who they are trying to hire - then post the job post in relavant scope
		* Prefer Korean Speaking only (based on community)
		* Prefer English speaking
		* Prefer All

- [ ] Figure out a way to communicate to job seekers, to display jobs that are FOR them. Because job posts are divided into two -
	1) for korean speakings only
	2) primarily English speaking (means either job poster wants non-koreans, or do not care who they hire, in this case english is absolutely necessary)

	Maybe show job seekers these options so we can filter Jobs for them -
		1. See jobs that are for All - English Speaking only
		2. See jobs that are for Korean speaking only

- [ ] make Eye Icon views
